# a) The type of attack is a known-plaintext attack.
#    Eve has both the plaintext "abcdefghi" and its corresponding
#    ciphertext "CABDEHFGL". This is a specific type of
#    known-plaintext attack where the plaintext is very simple and
#    often called a 'crib'.

# b) The size of the permutation key is 3.

#    We can deduce this by observing the block transformations.
#    The plaintext "abcdefghi" is likely divided into blocks of 3.
#    Plaintext blocks: "abc", "def", "ghi"
#    Ciphertext blocks: "CAB", "DEH", "FGL"

#    'abc' -> 'CAB'
#    'a' (pos 0) moves to pos 1
#    'b' (pos 1) moves to pos 2
#    'c' (pos 2) moves to pos 0
#    The permutation is (2, 0, 1)

# c) Vigen√®re Cipher with keyword "HEALTH"
